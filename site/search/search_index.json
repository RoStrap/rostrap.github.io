On that note if you have a mac and there is enough support (please send me a message if you are interested!), I may look into attempting to create a python version of the C# I have currently or I'll look into Mono.

This is a module built for Roblox studio to allow the usage of any OpenType (.otf) or TrueType (.ttf) font in Roblox by converting them into spritesheets and then wrapping normal GUI text objects so they work with the spiresheets.  This allows you to greatly expand your UI design options.   If you are interested in using Rbx_CustomFont in you game(s) then please view the  API page.  I have included a few fonts that come with the module, but if you would like to create your own font you are going to need the latest  .NET Framework  (sorry OSX users!). On that note if you have a mac and there is enough support (please send me a message if you are interested!), I may look into attempting to create a python version of the C# I have currently or I'll look into Mono. Otherwise, if you can run the .NET framework then you can read more about setting up your own font on the  setting up you own font wiki page.",

Errors can be optionally filtered by providing a list of  patterns which the error should match , otherwise all errors are caught by the function.
